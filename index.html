      <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p id=foxes>I've been watching and waiting and yearning and learning and seeking and failing and falling and hurting and sighing and crying yet oh so slowly dying, withering, quivering as I witness the unfolding and simultaneous decay of everything I've ever beheld and experienced to this day, in this one single moment, and eternity or two, I imagine expanding out purely to return to you. Are you here? Are you anywhere? I've searched for what feels like time, as my holofractographic memory oscillates infinitely in your mind. On the wind I've caught your whispers, they always send shivers down my spine, and ripples through my skin as fine hairs stand straight expecting your light to suddenly shine out from the echoes, echoes, echoes... Is that your hand I feel in mine?</p>

        <h3>10 Delicious Quotes</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Lokāḥ Samastāḥ Sukhino Bhavantu</li>
            <li>“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.” ~ Edward L. Bernays, Propaganda</li>
            <li>"Some imagine that self-realisation is the highest state within the realm of perception, but this is not so. The authentic ones have transcended the captivating illusions of duality by recognising that they are themselves unchanging Awareness, which is beyond all states. Having overcome the myriad distractions and temptations of the world, they confirm with authority personal identity to be mere illusion. Thus they rise above the play, consequence and concept of cause and effect. Such beings are themselves
            the living embodiment of Truth." ~ Mooji</li>
            <li>"There is no coming to consciousness without pain. People will do anyting, no matter how absurd, inorder to avoid facing their own Soul. One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious." ~ Carl Gustav Jung</li>
            <li>“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.” ~ Edward L. Bernays, Propaganda </li>
            <li>I am Ra. Let us give the example of the man who sees all the poker hands. He then knows the game. It is but child’s play to gamble, for it is no risk. The other hands are known. The possibilities are known and the hand will be played correctly but with no interest. In time/space and in the true-color green density, the hands of all are open to the eye. The thoughts, the feelings, the troubles, all these may be seen. There is no deception and no desire for deception. Thus much may be accomplished in harmony but the mind/body/spirit gains little polarity from this interaction. Let us re-examine this metaphor and multiply it into the longest poker game you can imagine, a lifetime. The cards are love, dislike, limitation, unhappiness, pleasure, etc. They are dealt and re-dealt and re-dealt continuously. You may, during this incarnation begin — and we stress begin — to know your own cards. You may begin to find the love within you. You may begin to balance your pleasure, your limitations, etc. However, your only indication of other-selves’ cards is to look into the eyes. You cannot remember your hand, their hands, perhaps even the rules of this game. This game can only be won by those who lose their cards in the melting influence of love; can only be won by those who lay their pleasures, their limitations, their all upon the table face up and say inwardly: “All, all of you players, each other-self, whatever your hand, I love you.” This is the game: to know, to accept, to forgive, to balance, and to open the self in love. This cannot be done without the forgetting, for it would carry no weight in the life of the mind/body/spirit beingness totality.</li>
            <li>This is the Paradox of the Universe, resulting from the Principle of Polarity which manifests when THE ALL begins to Create — hearken to it for it points the difference between half-wisdom and wisdom. While to THE INFINITE ALL, the Universe, its Laws, its Powers, its Life, its Phenomena, are as things witnessed in the state of Meditation or Dream; yet to all that is Finite, the Universe must be treated as Real, and life, and action, and thought, must be based thereupon, accordingly, although with an ever understanding of the Higher Truth. Each according to its own Plane and Laws. Were THE ALL to imagine that the Universe were indeed Reality, then woe to the Universe, for there would be then no escape from lower to higher, divineward — then would the Universe become a fixity and progress would become impossible. And if Man, owing to half-wisdom, acts and lives and thinks of the Universe as merely a dream (akin to his own finite dreams) then indeed does it so become for him, and like a sleep-walker he stumbles ever around and around in a circle, making no progress, and being forced into an awakening at last by his falling bruised and bleeding over the Natural Laws which he ignored. Keep your mind ever on the Star, but let your eyes watch over your footsteps, lest you fall into the mire by reason of your upward gaze. Remember the Divine Paradox, that while the Universe IS NOT, still IT IS. Remember ever the Two Poles of Truth — the Absolute and the Relative. Beware of half-Truths. ... We do not live in a world of dreams, but in an Universe which, while relative, is real so far as our lives and actions are concerned. Our business in the Universe is not to deny its existence, but to LIVE. using the Laws to rise from lower to higher — living on, doing the best that we can under the circumstances arising each day, and living, so far as is possible, to our highest ideas and ideals. The true Meaning of Life is not known to men on this plane — if, indeed, to any — but the highest authorities, and our own intuitions, teach us that we will make no mistake in living up to the best that is in us, so far as is possible, and realizing the Universal tendency in the same direction in spite of apparent evidences to the contrary. We are all on The Path — and the road leads upward ever, with frequent resting places. ~ The Kybalion</li>
            <li>"You are not a journey. The journey was a part of the play of consciousness, to have the taste of returning home to where you have never left. This is the yoga of life, of real knowledge, to bring together two things that were separate and to see there was never any separation. It only appeared through Maya... and it is a taste that every sentient being must taste, and to wake up into that which never sleeps. There is no you, there is no ultimate truth to find apart from you, but this you is not a person. This is the greatest discovery in the human kingdom. The truth is One. The One appearing as many, as other, for a while... and this other enabled the consciouness to create the sense of interrelated opposites, duality, conflict, confusion, creativity, separateness, specialness, arrogance, evil, good, worship, life, death, heavan, hell, gods and demons, but it's only One. And just like it, you go to a movie... it cannot just be good good good good, nice nice nice nice. There must be some struggle, there must be a fight, there must be a few bums, there must be a few divorces, some deaths, some coming togethers, some aspirations, all of this: this is gods' movie. And he alone is real. This is why I say there has never been any real dialogues in the universe, it's all a monologue. And yet each One has to get baptized in this understanding. It cannot be only an idea in your mind, it cannot be religious philosophy, or speculation, it cannot be dream anymore. All the sages, the saints, the prophets, they were the 'alarm clocks' in the dream. But they're awake. They are the Ones who are awake inside this living dream. When you are awake, the dream takes on a blessedness about it, it is seen with new eyes, it is seen from a new perspective, a perspective of love, of unity, of openness, of Oneness, it is seen very differently. Because the person is always a distortion, it is always a corruption, it never sees clearly because it sees with eyes of selfishness, with psychological self-consciousness, with aspiration, with judgment. You're waking up is not to dismiss this world, on the contrary it infuses light and love into gods play. It is just the birth pains." ~ Mooji</li>
            <li>"Once, in a past time, I spoke to the Dweller.
Asked of the mystery of time and space.
Asked him the question that surged in my being,
saying: O Master, what is time?
Then to me spoke HE, the Master:
Know ye, O Thoth, in the beginning
there was VOID and nothingness,
a timeless, spaceless, nothingness.
And into the nothingness came a thought,
purposeful, all-pervading,
and It filled the VOID.
There existed no matter, only force,
a movement, a vortex, or vibration
of the purposeful thought
that filled the VOID.
And I questioned the Master, saying:
Was this thought eternal?
And answered me the DWELLER, Saying:
In the beginning, there was eternal thought,
and for thought to be eternal, time must exist.
So into the all-pervading thought
grew the LAW of TIME.
Aye time which exists through all space,
floating in a smooth, rhythmic movement
that is eternally in a state of fixation.

Time changes not,
but all things change in time.
For time is the force
that holds events separate,
each in its own proper place.
Time is not in motion,
but ye move through time
as your consciousness
moves from one event to another.
Aye, by time yet exist, all in all,
an eternal ONE existence.
Know ye that even though in the time ye are separate,
yet still are ONE, in all times existent.
Ceased then the voice of the DWELLER,
and departed I to ponder on time.
For knew I that in these words lay wisdom
and a way to explore the mysteries of time." ~ Thoth, The Key of Time</li>
            <li>"My heart is afraid it will have to suffer," the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky. "Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity." ~ Paulo Coelho</li>
